          <p>
            I am an educator teaching I.T, DevOps, and
            Programming(Front/Back-end) for four years, who loves to help the
            next generations of exceptional students in the tech sector.
            Building and designing lessons with labs to ensure students get
            particle experience in the field with mentoring & tutoring.
          </p>
          <p>
            These labs are built using Python, allowing students to practice
            with C, C++, and C# Python, JavaScript, Java, AWS, Azure, and GCP
            environments. These labs can automatically grade students'
            performances and give immediate feedback. Professors can also get a
            detailed report on how the students did as a group or as individuals
            so proper decisions can be made.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an instructor with over 1000+ students, I ensure each cohort
            receives the passion and attention they deserve to succeed in their
            chosen field. I used my expertise to teach students individually and
            as a group to encourage teamwork. A common issue students encounter
            is needing to learn soft skills like communication, collaboration,
            and future planning. We can help the students improve these
            essential skills with highly interactive group assessments and
            custom build labs.

          <div>
            <p>
              I worked on Generation Global team to make a Cloud Engineer
              Program for all Generation districts. This program is designed to
              help teach new students how to use GCP and use their boost skill
              platform, including how to use Linux, Terraform, Ansible, and
              more. By the end of the program, students will be qualified Google
              Cloud Digital Leader & Associate Cloud Engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
              This program had over 60+ lessons, in which I was responsible for
              documentation, lesson planning, instructions, material, quality of
              assurance, reviews, PowerSlides, Draw.Io diagrams, Lab setups, and
              more.
            </p>
            <p>
              The program's mock cohort started in the UK, which was an
              incredible success and will be a future model for teaching
              students how to interact with the cloud thanks to our partnership
              with google.

            <p>
              Build powerful lessons for Linux Operations, part of TIFC, a
              design concept in which we make lesson plans that can be easily
              swapped in or out of other programs when needed. This ensures
              students from DevOps, Cloud Engineering, Software Development, and
              other similar programs swap in the required class for their
              curriculum needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              This design is custom-made for Generation, including art assets,
              design principles, and well-documented lesson plans to ensure all
              instructors can conduct Linux in their curriculum.
            </p>
            <p>
              We ensure the success of this program with our team leader James
              Belchamber, our BSM(Behavior skill Mindset), Elise Guimaraes, and
              intern Ted Logan.

              Help build extra curriculum for the current JWD(Junior web
              Developer) & JFS(Java Full Stack) programs by making Quizizz, an
              online tool to help make tests, and many Github repositories that
              give more activities for the students like:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>HTML</li>
              <li>CSS</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
              This extra curriculum was designed by I (Lazaro), Anderson, and
              Zoe to help students have more projects under their belt and give
              them more experience.
